# Semantic-Data-Integration

The purpose of this report is to analyze world population data using mediated schema development. By using multiple
datasets, we aim to answer various competency questions related to world population trends, demographics, and growth
rates. Our use case focuses on analyzing world population data to understand population trends, demographics, and growth
rates over time.

### Datasets
+ World Bank - World Development Indicators
+ Kaggle
+ United Nations - World Population Prospects

Schema matching is crucial for integrating diverse data sources, ensuring interoperability and data quality across datasets
from Kaggle, United Nations , and the World Bank. In this project, we evaluate three schema matching techniques: Edit
Distance, Jaccard Measure, and Semantic Similarity. We develop these matchers, experiment with different strategies
to combine their results, and refine the matches using various selection strategies. Finally, we analyze which matchers,
combinations, and selections are most effective, providing insights for future data integration efforts across multiple het-
erogeneous datasets.
